To run:
1) Create a directory. In the directory you may create a maximum of 4 files:
		a)consonants- Put all the consonants in your script/language in the file. eg, ক , খ (ka, kha) etc
		b)pre_semivowels- Put all the semivowels that come before a consonant. eg,  ি, ে, ৈ  (e kaar, a kaar, oi kaar )
		c)post_semivowels- Put all the semivowels that come after a consonant, eg,  া, ী (aa kaar, ee kaar)
		d)rest- Put everything else here, like digits, punctuation, conjuncts, special characters, vowels
		
Now you need to know the directory in your system where all the font files are kept. In Ubuntu the truetype fonts are at /usr/share/fonts/truetype/.


Nowt type (for bengali for example)  python generate.py -fd /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bengali-fonts/ -l beng -a beng.alphabet/

-fd takes the ttf fonts directory as input
-l takes the language to be trained as input
-a takes the alphabet characters folder as input

This command will generate many images and corresponding box files in beng.images. In the end it generates 5 files.
1)unicharset
2)Microfeat
3)normproto
4)pffmtable
5)inttemp

These 5 files are needed by Tesseract-OCR engine to add a new script support. In addition dawg files are also required, for which you do not require
this tool.

And yeah, this is work in progress.
